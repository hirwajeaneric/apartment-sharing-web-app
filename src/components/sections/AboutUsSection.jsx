                ISMA is an acronym of the word: "I Share My Apartment".
                <br /><br /> 
                It was inspired by <strong>NKURIKIYINGOMA Honorine</strong> the owner and founder of ISMA 
                after realizing that there was a rising crisis of students from rural areas
                and international students who were finding it very hard to find houses to rent
                nearby university campuses, yet there being apartments and other houses which would
                be rented and shared by many people if they had agreements for that.
